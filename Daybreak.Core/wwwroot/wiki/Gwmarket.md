# Gw Market

Daybreak integrates with [Gw Market](https://gwmarket.net/) to provide automatic inventory scanning and player certification. Thanks to the folks at [Gw Market Discord](https://discord.gg/6GfNaceb) for allowing me to integrate their service into Daybreak.

## Getting started

1. Expand the Services menu section and open Guild Wars Marketplace view
